This is a project to attempt to make a set of Rings for mapping.  The general idea is to make a
vizualization for multivariate indexing.  Often times when using an index the weight of one category can
get lost within the aggregate score.  The rings that we are trying to create will provide was with an
interactive way to show all the data so that each individual data point can be examined.
